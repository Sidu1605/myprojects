## Total I had Divided into 3 file 
### 1. EDA 
     0. Imported Requeired Libraries for EDA.
     1. Splitted dataset as train and test sets
     2. Data Analysis and Preparation
         a. Understand the dataset
         b. checking datatypes and find whether any values are miss leading 
         c. reducing large unique class in categorical features.
         d.checking statistical summary
         e. Checking Distribution of Variables using various plots
             1. Distribution of Numarical features
                   A. Distribution of Discrete variables
                       1. Counting Discrete feature class
                       2. Comparing Discrete feature calss using Property_Sale_Price feature
                   B. Distribution of Continuous variables
                        1. Distribution of Continuous variables in testing dataset.
                   C. Distribution of Year variables
                        1. Checking year_features with Property_Sale_Price feature.
             2. Distribution of Categorical features
                    A. Counting categorical feature classes.
                    B. Comparing categorical feature classes using Property_Sale_Price feature.
    ## backup the datasets
### 2.   turengineering created Function
    0. Imported Libraries and Datasets witch helps to Feature Engineering.
    1. outliers,
        a. check outliers with boxplot for continuous features
        b. treated Outliers with Winsorization Technique
    2. missing values,
        a. Created table for missing values details 
        b. checked whether Independent feature null values mean effection on not null values mean.
        c. plot heatmap for null values
        d. Treated null values based on null values status in the Independent and Dependent features 
    3. Multi-Coolinearity Treatment
        a. Check Coolinearity using Correlation matrix and plot heatmap
        b. drop high coolinear features
    4. whether both train and test datasets independent feature class are same or not (for discrete & categorical features)
        a. checked train dataset or test dataset independent feature class are having same class or not 
        b. my train and test datasets independent features not same so i treated two way.
               1. if missing class values count is less then 20 then, converted those class with mode
               2. if missing class values count is greater then 20 or 20 then, imported missing class  
    5. Converting Categorical features into numarical or binary values.
        a. Odinal features classes Converted into numarical values
        b. Nominal features class Converted into binary values.
        
### 3.Feature Selection and Model building
    1. Create Result table
    2. Selected Feature from Various techniques and find best feature selection method.
    3. Trained Base Model and Evalived and stored result in Result table.
    4. Trained various model and evaluved, find the Base Model.
